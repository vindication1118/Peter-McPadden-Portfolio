While hunting you hear screams nearby. Rushing to see what is going on you see a small village being terrorized by a gang of thieves.
Do you (A)ttack or use (M)agic?
One of the thieves bellows in pain as he takes an arrow to his upper arm.
One of the thieves falls dead to the ground as he gets hit with a fireball.
Seeing how quickly you dispensed with some of their gang, the remaining thieves run away.  Do you (P)ersue or (G)o home?
